<p>Vaccines help save lives;

Every year, vaccines help save the lives of millions of people around the world.<br> That includes children. If your child is unvaccinated, they have a higher chance of getting sick from vaccine-preventable diseases.<br> And in some cases, it could be serious.<br><br>

Vaccines help train your child’s immune system to fight disease.<br><br><br>

In only a matter of weeks after getting a vaccine, your child’s immune system <br><br><br>(their defense system against sickness) will start to help protect them against a vaccine-preventable disease. Your child isn’t fully vaccinated <br>until after they get all recommended doses of a vaccine.<br>

So, it makes sense to get your child vaccinated before they come<br> into contact with certain diseases at school, on the playground, or when they visit new places.
